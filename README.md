# advance_cnn_customs
This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive example of building custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow's Functional API. It demonstrates how to create complex CNN architectures, implement custom layers, and use custom subclasses for enhanced flexibility and control in your deep learning models.
